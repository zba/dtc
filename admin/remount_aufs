# This script does an umount call for each folder that needs to be
# unmounted, and an mount call whenever a new virtualhost is active.
# It does that by comparing /proc/mounts and /var/lib/dtc/etc/aufs_list
# which is generated by DTC.
#
# If for some reason you need to umount everything, you can do:
# for i in `cat /proc/mounts | grep aufs | cut -d" " -f2 | more` ; do umount $i ; done
# which will umount all aufs mounts present in the system
#
# Note that since this script is checking against all mounted AUFS,
# you cannot use AUFS for anything else than DTC.
# An ignore list should be implemented to avoid such an issue, but
# for the moment, I have no time to implement it.
